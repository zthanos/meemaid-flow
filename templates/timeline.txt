 ### Summary of Mermaid.js Timeline Diagram Syntax Rules

#### Basic Structure
- **Start with `timeline` keyword**: Begins any timeline diagram.
- **Title (optional)**: Use `title` followed by the title text to add a title to the timeline.
- **Time Period and Event**: Each entry starts with a time period, followed by a colon (`:`), then one or more events separated by colons if needed.
  ```markdown
  {time period} : {event} : {event} ...
  ```

#### Grouping Time Periods
- **Sections (optional)**: Use `section` followed by the section name to group time periods under a specific section.
  ```markdown
  section Section Name
  {time period} : {event}
  ```
- **Default Behavior**: If no sections are defined, all time periods will be placed in a default section with individual color schemes for each time period and its events.

#### Text Wrapping
- **Automatic wrapping**: Long text for time periods or events is automatically wrapped to fit within the diagram.
- **Line breaks**: Use `<br>` to force line breaks in text.

#### Styling
- **Color Scheme**: Each section has a color scheme, and each time period and event under a section follow similar colors.
- **Customization**: 
  - Use `cScale0` to `cScale11` for background colors (up to 12 sections).
  - Use `cScaleLabel0` to `cScaleLabel11` for foreground colors.
  - Default values can be overridden using `mermaid.initialize`.
- **Themes**: Mermaid supports multiple themes with different color schemes. Themes can be changed via initialization settings or directives.

#### Integration
- **Lazy Loading**: Timeline uses experimental lazy loading and async rendering, which may change in future releases.
- **Web Page Implementation**: Include timeline diagrams using the following script:
  ```html
  <script type="module">
    import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
  </script>
  ```

This summary covers the basic syntax and rules for creating Timeline diagrams with Mermaid.js, including optional features like sections, text wrapping, styling, and theme customization.
