 ### Summary of Mermaid.js Packet Diagram Syntax (v11.0.0+)

#### Introduction
- **Packet Diagrams** are visual representations used to illustrate the structure and contents of network packets.
- These diagrams are particularly useful for understanding and representing the structure of network packets, which are fundamental units of data transferred over a network.

#### Usage
- Targeted at developers, network engineers, educators, and students who need a clear and concise way to represent packet structures.

#### Basic Syntax Structure
- **Title Line**: The first line after `packet` defines the title of the diagram.
- **Field Definitions**: Subsequent lines define different fields within the packet using bit ranges or specific counts.
  - **Single-bit blocks**: Defined with a single colon (`:`), e.g., `start: "Block name"`.
  - **Multi-bit blocks**: Defined with a dash and colon (`:-`), e.g., `start-end: "Block name"`.
  - **Bit Counts**: Introduced in v11.7.0, allow setting the number of bits automatically, e.g., `+8: "Block name"`.

#### Key Commands and Keywords
- **packet**: Command to start a new packet diagram.
- **start**, **start-end**: Define single or multi-bit blocks without manual bit counting.
- **+<count>**: Automatically set the number of bits for a block, starting from the end of the previous field.
- **"Block name"**: Description of the data block within the packet.

#### Common Patterns and Examples
- Example:
  ```mermaid
  packet
    start: "Source MAC Address" +8
    +12: "VLAN Tag"
    16-23: "Source IP Address"
    24-31: "Destination IP Address"
    32-95: "Payload Data"
  ```

#### Important Rules and Constraints
- **Bit Ranges**: The range (e.g., `0-15`) indicates the bit positions in the packet.
- **Field Description**: Each line after the title should include a brief description of what the field represents, enclosed in quotes.
- **Configuration**: Refer to the configuration guide for detailed settings and options specific to Mermaid Chart configurations.

This summary provides a clear overview of how to use Mermaid.js to create packet diagrams, including syntax rules and common usage patterns.
