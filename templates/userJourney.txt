 ### Summary of Mermaid.js Syntax Rules for DiagramType.USER_JOURNEY Diagrams

#### Basic Structure
- **User Journey Diagrams** describe user workflows within systems, applications, or websites.
- Each diagram is divided into sections, each representing a part of the task users are trying to complete.
- The syntax includes:
  - `Task name` followed by a colon (`:`).
  - A score (a number between 1 and 5) followed by a colon (`:`).
  - A comma-separated list of actors involved in that section of the task.

#### Key Commands and Keywords
- **Code Block**: Enclose Mermaid code within triple backticks (\`\`\`) or use the `Ctrl + Enter` shortcut to render.
- **Run Button**: Use the "Run ▶" button to visualize the diagram.

#### Common Patterns and Examples
1. **Basic Task Representation**:
   ```mermaid
   userJourney
       title My User Journey
       
       section Part 1: Register
       1: John, Mary
       2: Alice
       
       section Part 2: Login
       3: John
       4: Bob
   ```

2. **Detailed Task with Scores**:
   ```mermaid
   userJourney
       title Complex User Journey
       
       section Part 1: Register
       1: [5] John, Mary
       2: [3] Alice
       
       section Part 2: Login
       3: [4] John
       4: [2] Bob
   ```

#### Important Rules and Constraints
- **Task Name**: Followed by a colon (`:`), e.g., `Register`.
- **Score**: A number between 1 and 5, inclusive, followed by a colon (`:`). Scores help prioritize or rate the importance of each section.
- **Actors**: Listed after the score in square brackets if needed, separated by commas. For example: `[5] John, Mary` indicates that both John and Mary are involved at a high level of detail (score 5).

#### Usage Notes
- Ensure clarity in identifying key tasks and actors for each section of the user journey.
- Use scores to highlight critical or frequently used paths within the workflow.
