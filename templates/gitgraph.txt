 ### Summary of Mermaid.js Syntax for GitGraph Diagrams

#### Basic Structure and Usage
- **Declaration**: Begin by declaring the diagram type using `gitgraph` keyword. This tells Mermaid to parse the code as a Git graph.
- **Default Branch**: The default branch is initialized as 'main' (formerly called 'master').
- **Commit Declaration**: Use `commit` keyword to declare commits, optionally providing an ID and type attributes.
- **Branch Creation**: Use `branch` keyword to create new branches. New branches are set as the current branch automatically.
- **Branch Switching**: Use `checkout` keyword to switch to existing branches.
- **Merging Branches**: Use `merge` keyword to merge one branch into another, creating a merge commit.
- **Cherry Picking**: Use `cherry-pick` keyword to bring specific commits from other branches onto the current branch.

#### Key Commands and Keywords
- **commit**: Registers a new commit on the current branch.
  - Attributes: `id`, `type`, `tag`
- **branch**: Creates a new branch and sets it as the current branch.
  - Usage: `branch "new_branch_name"`
- **checkout**: Switches to an existing branch.
  - Usage: `checkout "existing_branch_name"`
- **merge**: Merges one branch into another, creating a merge commit.
  - Attributes: `id`, `tag`, `type`
- **cherry-pick**: Brings specific commits from other branches onto the current branch.
  - Usage: `cherry-pick id: "commit_id"`

#### Common Patterns and Examples
1. **Basic Git Graph with Default Branch:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       commit
       commit
       commit
   ```
2. **Adding Custom IDs to Commits:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       commit id: "commit_1"
       commit id: "commit_2"
       commit id: "commit_3"
   ```
3. **Creating and Switching Branches:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       branch new_branch
       checkout new_branch
       commit
       commit
       checkout main
   ```
4. **Merging Branches with Custom Attributes:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       commit
       commit
       branch develop
       commit
       checkout main
       merge develop id: "merge_commit" tag: "release" type: REVERSE
   ```
5. **Cherry Picking Commits:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       commit
       commit
       cherry-pick id: "commit_id_from_other_branch"
   ```

#### Important Rules and Constraints
- **Branch Names**: Must be unique and not conflict with existing branch names or Mermaid keywords.
- **Commit IDs**: Should correspond to actual commits in the repository; otherwise, errors will occur.
- **Cherry Picking**: Requires specifying an existing commit ID from another branch. The specified parent commit must exist on the merge commit being cherry-picked.
- **Theme Variables**: Support customization of up to 8 branches using theme variables. Beyond this limit, variables are reused cyclically.

#### Configuration Options
- **showBranches**: Controls visibility of branch names and lines (default is true).
- **showCommitLabel**: Controls visibility of commit labels (default is true).
- **mainBranchName**: Sets the name of the default/root branch (default is 'main').
- **parallelCommits**: Allows commits to be shown at the same level if they are a certain distance away from their parent.

#### Examples of Configuration
1. **Hiding Branch Names and Lines:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       showBranches: false
       commit
       commit
   ```
2. **Rotating Commit Labels:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       rotateCommitLabel: true
       commit
       commit
   ```
3. **Customizing Main Branch Name:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       mainBranchName: "MetroLine1"
       commit
       commit
   ```
4. **Setting Orientation to Top-to-Bottom:**
   ```mermaid
   gitgraph
       TB: true
       commit
       commit
   ```
