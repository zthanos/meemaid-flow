 ### Summary of Mermaid.js Pie Chart Syntax for DiagramType.PIE Diagrams

#### Basic Structure and Commands
- **Start the diagram with `pie` keyword.**
- **Optional**: Use `showData` to display data values after labels.
- **Optional**: Use `title` followed by a string value to add a title to the pie chart.
- **Labels for each slice are enclosed in double quotes (`" "`)**.
- **Each label is followed by a colon (`:`) and a positive numeric value** (supported up to two decimal places).

#### Key Commands and Keywords
1. **pie**: Initiates the pie chart diagram.
2. **showData**: Optionally displays data values next to their corresponding labels.
3. **title [titlevalue]**: Adds a title to the pie chart, enclosed in double quotes (`" "`).
4. **[label] : [dataValue]**: Defines each slice of the pie chart with a label and its associated value.

#### Common Patterns and Examples
- Basic syntax for creating a pie chart:
  ```mermaid
  pie
    title My Pie Chart
    "Slice 1" : 30
    "Slice 2" : 55
    "Slice 3" : 15
  ```
- Including `showData` to display values:
  ```mermaid
  pie
    showData
    title My Pie Chart
    "Slice 1" : 30.45
    "Slice 2" : 55.12
    "Slice 3" : 14.43
  ```
- Adding a title to the chart:
  ```mermaid
  pie
    title My Pie Chart
    "Slice 1" : 30.45
    "Slice 2" : 55.12
    "Slice 3" : 14.43
  ```

#### Important Rules and Constraints
- **Data Values Must Be Positive**: All values must be positive numbers greater than zero. Negative values are not allowed, as they will result in an error.
- **Label Order**: Pie slices are ordered clockwise based on the order of labels provided.
- **Optional Parameters**: `showData` and `title` are optional but can enhance the readability and clarity of the chart.

This summary provides a clear understanding of how to create pie charts using Mermaid.js, including basic syntax, key commands, common usage patterns, and important constraints.
