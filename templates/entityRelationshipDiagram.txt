 ### Summary of Mermaid.js Syntax Rules for Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

#### Basic Structure
- **Entities**: Represented by singular nouns and are mandatory in every statement.
- **Relationships**: Defined using lines with end markers representing cardinality.
- **Syntax**: Consists of `<first-entity> [<relationship> <second-entity> : <relationship-label>]`.
  - Example: `PROPERTY ||--|{ ROOM : contains`

#### Key Commands and Keywords
- **Entities**: Names are often capitalized but not required; support any Unicode characters.
- **Relationships**: Use cardinality markers (`oo`, `}o{`, etc.) to describe the number of instances.
- **Attributes**: Can be added to entities with type and name, e.g., `{color: red, size: large}`.
- **Unicode Text**: Supported for entity names, relationships, and attributes.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Supported within statements (not for keys or comments).

#### Common Patterns and Examples
- **Basic Entity Relationship**: 
  ```mermaid
  CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
  ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
  ```
- **Attributes on Entities**:
  ```mermaid
  ENTITY {
    name: John Doe
    age: 30
    email: john.doe@example.com
  }
  ```
- **Cardinality and Relationships**:
  ```mermaid
  PERSON ||--o{ CAR : owns
  CAR ||--|{ TIRE : has
  ```

#### Important Rules and Constraints
- **Relationship Labels**: Typically read from the perspective of the first entity (e.g., `A contains B`).
- **Cardinality Markers**: Outer character represents maximum, inner represents minimum values.
- **Directionality**: Can be specified using `TB`, `BT`, `RL`, or `LR`.
- **Styling**: Nodes can have specific styles applied, including border thickness and background color.
- **Layout**: Default is Dagre; ELK layout can be configured via YAML frontmatter.

#### Additional Features
- **Class Definitions**: For applying consistent styling to multiple nodes (e.g., `classDef className fill:#f9f,...`).
- **Shorthand Syntax**: For attaching classes to nodes and relationships (`nodeId:::className1,className2`).
- **Default Class**: Applies styles to all nodes without specific class definitions.

#### Configuration
- **Layout Options**: Default is Dagre; ELK layout can be specified in YAML frontmatter.
- **Version Requirement**: Mermaid version 9.4+ with lazy-loading configuration enabled for ERD rendering.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the syntax and features supported by Mermaid.js for creating Entity Relationship Diagrams, suitable for both technical documentation and diagram generation purposes.
