 ### Summary of Mermaid.js MindMap Syntax Rules for DiagramType.MINDMAP Diagrams

#### Basic Structure
- **Indentation**: Sets the hierarchy levels in the mind map. The root node is at the top level and subsequent nodes are indented to show their relationship.
- **Shapes**: Nodes can be displayed using various shapes like square, rounded square, circle, hexagon, etc., with a syntax similar to flowchart nodes.
- **Icons and Classes**: Icons can be added using `::icon()` syntax. Custom classes can be applied for styling (e.g., changing background color or font size).

#### Key Commands and Keywords
- **Indentation**: Determines the hierarchy level of each node.
- **Shapes**: Specifies the visual representation of nodes (`Square`, `Rounded square`, etc.).
- **::icon()**: Adds icons to nodes using a specific syntax.
- **Classes**: Applies custom CSS classes for styling (e.g., changing text color, background color).

#### Common Patterns and Examples
1. **Basic MindMap Example**:
    ```mermaid
    mindmap
    Root
    A
    B
    C
    ```
2. **MindMap with Shapes**:
    ```mermaid
    mindmap
    Root
    A::[#FF0000]Square
    B::[#00FF00]Rounded square
    C::[#0000FF]Circle
    ```
3. **MindMap with Icons and Classes**:
    ```mermaid
    mindmap
    Root::[#FFFFFF]((mindmap is a long thing))::icon-color=red
    A::[#FFFFFF]::icon::material-icons lock
    B::[#FFFFFF]::icon::font-awesome leaf
    C::[#FFFFFF]::icon::octicons(geo)
    ```
4. **MindMap with Markdown Strings**:
    ```mermaid
    mindmap
    Root
    A**Bold Text**
    B*Italic Text*
    ```

#### Important Rules and Constraints
- **Indentation Clarity**: Ensure clear indentation to define the hierarchy correctly; otherwise, Mermaid will attempt to infer the parent-child relationships.
- **Experimental Feature**: MindMaps are experimental, meaning their syntax and properties can change in future releases.
- **Async Rendering**: For versions 9.4.0 and above, mind maps use lazy loading for rendering, which simplifies integration but may require updates based on future changes.
- **Layouts**: Supports a Tidy Tree layout for better organization of the mind map. Configuration instructions are available in MermaidChart.com.

This summary provides a concise overview of the syntax and features supported by Mermaid.js for creating MindMap diagrams, including basic structure, shape customization, icon integration, class application, and handling hierarchy through indentation.
